<!-- Scope determines what can see a variable
-Global
-Local

A paretn passes all its information down
a child does not pass it's informatioj up
a child can see its patents but not vice versa
by up/down, we mean functions! 

varilable has 3 states
UNDECLARED
DECLARED, but UNSET (aka UNDEFINED)
SET

-->

<script type="text/javascript">


function child(a){
	a = 4;
	// a += 2; // a is local here
	// console.log("a's value inside the function:",a)
	return a;
}

	var a = 2;
	// if you dont have a 'var' js will assume its global
	// do NOT do this. always include 'var'
	// a = 2;
	console.log("a's value outside the function:",a);
	// we call the child, the child changes a to 4
	childReturnsValue = child(a);
	console.log(childReturnsValue);
	// the child changed the variable, its still 4
	console.log("a's value outside the function:",a);
